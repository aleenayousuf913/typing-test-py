Welcome to my first repository in Python! 

I have been learning python for a little bit now, but this is one of my starter projects: a terminal-based Python application to test your typing speed

Features
- calculates WPM
- measures accuracy
- no external libraries required

Sample Output:

Welcome to the Typing Speed Test!

Type the following sentence:

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy sleeping dog


Your input: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy sleeping dog 


--- Results ---

Time taken: 14.72 seconds

Speed: 43.21 words per minute (WPM)

Accuracy: 100.0%


P.S.
If someone could teach me how to directly link my code to the repository; I have just been copy-pasting my code into github
